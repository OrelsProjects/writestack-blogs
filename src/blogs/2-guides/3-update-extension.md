# 🔄 How to Update the WriteStack Chrome Extension {#update-writestack-extension}

Your guide to keeping the WriteStack Chrome Extension up-to-date so scheduling and automation always run smoothly.

---

## 🚀 Why Updates Matter {#why-updates-matter}

I release updates to WriteStack's extension frequently to improve reliability, fix bugs, and ensure full compatibility with Substack’s latest changes.

Usually, Chrome updates the extension automatically, so you don’t need to worry about it — everything happens quietly in the background.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Updates don’t happen instantly. Chrome may take several hours (or days) to update extensions automatically — so doing it manually is faster and safer.

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Open Chrome Extensions Page {#open-extensions-page}

1. Open Chrome and go to  
   **chrome://extensions/**
2. You’ll see all your installed extensions.

👉 Make sure **WriteStack** appears in the list.  
If not, reinstall it here: [WriteStack Extension on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/writestack/emdlbnkhjpfcooclfbodmhkhkohcjaoa)

---

## ⚙️ Step 2 — Enable Developer Mode {#enable-developer-mode}

At the top right corner of the extensions page, you’ll see a toggle called **Developer mode**.  
Turn it **on**.

This will reveal new buttons like **Update**, **Remove**, and **Reload**.

---

## 🔁 Step 3 — Click “Update” {#click-update}

Click the **Update** button that appears once Developer Mode is on.

This forces Chrome to fetch the latest version of the WriteStack extension immediately.

You’ll see a quick “Updated” confirmation message at the bottom of the screen.

## 🧠 Step 4 — Verify the Version {#verify-version}

After updating, scroll to find **WriteStack** in your extensions list again.

Click **Details**, and check the **Version number**.

Make sure it matches the latest one listed on the Chrome Web Store page (scroll down to **Details**):
👉 [WriteStack Extension Latest Version](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/writestack/emdlbnkhjpfcooclfbodmhkhkohcjaoa)

If it matches — you’re up to date.  
If not, try clicking **Update** again or restart Chrome.

## 🧩 Step 5 — Re-enable the Extension (if needed) {#re-enable-extension}

If the update process disabled the extension for any reason, click the toggle next to WriteStack to **re-enable** it.

You should see the WriteStack icon appear again on your toolbar.

3. Click the **pin icon** to keep it visible.

## 💬 FAQ {#faq}

### Will I lose my scheduled Notes if I update?
No. Your schedules and drafts are stored safely on WriteStack — updating the extension doesn’t affect your data.

### Do I need to restart my computer?
No. Just restart Chrome after updating to apply the latest background scripts.
