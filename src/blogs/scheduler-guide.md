# 🗓️ WriteStack Scheduler Guide {#writestack-scheduler-guide}

Your guide to scheduling and automating Substack Notes with WriteStack.

---

## 🚀 What the Scheduler Does {#what-the-scheduler-does}

The WriteStack Scheduler helps you **stay consistent**, **save time**, and **batch your writing**.  
You can plan your Notes in advance and WriteStack will automatically publish them on Substack at the scheduled time.

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Install the WriteStack Chrome Extension {#install-extension}

To make scheduling work, you need the WriteStack Chrome Extension.

👉 [Download the WriteStack Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/writestack/emdlbnkhjpfcooclfbodmhkhkohcjaoa)

Once installed, pin it to your Chrome toolbar for easy access.

> **Note:** WriteStack works on any Chromium-based browser — such as **Google Chrome**, **Brave**, **Edge**, or **Arc**.

---

## 🕒 Step 2 — Schedule a Note {#schedule-note}

1. Open the [**WriteStack Notes**](https://writestack.io/notes) page.  
2. Write, generate or repurpose a Note.  
3. Click **Add to Queue** or **Schedule Note**.

That’s it — an alarm will be created in your browser for that time.

---

## ⚡ Step 3 — Keep It Running {#keep-it-running}

For your scheduled Note to post successfully, make sure:

1. **WriteStack is running** in a Chrome (or Chromium) browser.  
2. **Your computer is on and unlocked.** 
3. **You’re logged in to Substack** on the same Chrome profile you used for WriteStack.  
4. **The WriteStack extension is active** (not removed or paused).

If any of these aren’t true when the schedule goes off, the Note won’t post.

> 💡 Most people miss scheduled Notes because their computer is **locked or asleep** at the scheduled time.

*P.S.
This is a Substack limitation. If anybody offers you a tool that schedules from their servers, you're putting your Substack account at risk.*

## Possible issues {#possible-issues}

### Note schedule was missed

Note schedules that are not sent within 10 minutes of the scheduled time will be marked as missed. They will not be sent automatically.

In order to resend the note, you can either:
1. One-click post it from the app/extension.
2. Change the schedule time to a later time.
3. One-click post it from the email you'll get 20 minutes after the note was missed.

**Important:** If you miss a bunch of notes, they will not be sent in a batch when you open your Chrome. They will stay in the queue, marked as missed.

Here's how a missed note looks:

### Schedule warning

Sometimes you will see a yellow triangle next to the scheduled note. That could be because:
1. Scheduled the note from a different computer/profile/browser.
2. The extension was deleted and reinstalled.
3. Something went wrong.

The third option is very rare. Now, if you see the warnings, you can easily fix it by clicking the "Fix scheduling warning" button.
Here's how it looks:

This will fix all the warnings of all the notes that have a warning in a few seconds.

## 💬 FAQ {#faq}

### What happens if my computer is off when the schedule time arrives?
The Note won’t be sent and you will receive a missed note email. Keep your computer **on, unlocked, and online** during the scheduled time.

### Do I need to keep the dashboard open?
No. As long as your browser is open and the WriteStack extension is installed, you’re good..

### What if I uninstall the extension?
Your schedules won’t run. Reinstall the extension to resume scheduling.
