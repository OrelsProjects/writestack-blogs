# 1. Sorting Your Notes Properly {#sorting}

# 2. Your Most Important Filter: Free Subs {#free-subs}
Sorting by **Free Subs** instantly shows your **top-performing Notes of all time**.

These Notes did the following:
- reached the right audience  
- hit the right tone  
- had a strong hook  
- created curiosity  
- converted casual readers into subscribers  

### What to do with these Notes
**Repurpose them**. Substack doesn’t show your Notes to everyone. Most of your subscribers missed it.
I repeat my top-performing Notes *AT LEAST* once a month.

Here are some ways to repurpose your Notes:

1. **Click a Note → Save to Drafts → Add to Queue**  
   This is the fastest way to reuse a proven Note.

2. **Rewrite a stronger version**  
   Click the AI icon at the bottom left and rewrite however you like

3. **Use WriteStack AI to generate variants**  
   Click the AI icon at the bottom left and ask for variations.

   #### Pro tip
   If the Note brought many subs, write 3–5 Notes expanding on the idea.

# 3. Repurposing Notes The Right Way {#repurpose}

Repurposing is not recycling.  
Repurposing is *doubling down* on what already works.

### Practical repurposing strategies

**a. Repost with a twist**  
Change:
- the opening hook  
- the angle  
- the length  
- one story or example  
- the CTA  

**b. Turn it into a list**  
If the original was 1 idea → rewrite as 3–5 points.

**c. Expand it into a long Note (with “Read more”)**  
This increases clicks and dwell time.

**d. Add an image**  
Images dramatically increase revisit count and conversion on Substack Notes.

# 4. Using Notes That Worked to Build New Ones {#build-new}

### Use WriteStack AI to generate variants

1. Click a Note  
2. Click AI icon at the bottom left ->  **Go to Chat**  
![WriteStack AI](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/notes-performance/go-to-chat.png "scale=1.7")

1. Ask for variations:
   - “Make this shorter.”  
   - “Make this more opinionated.”  
   - “Rewrite it as actionable advice.”  
   - “Keep the core idea but change the story.”  

This gives you **4–10 versions** of a Note that already performed well.

Reposting winners is how you grow consistently.

# 5. Identifying Patterns in Winning Notes {#patterns}

When you look at your top Notes, ask:

- What tone did I use?  
- Was it emotional, educational, or personal?  
- Was it a story or a punchline?  
- Did it have emojis?  
- Was it long or short?  
- Did it include an image?  
- Did it challenge something?  
- Did I share a personal struggle or a win?  

### The goal  
Find **your personal formula**.

Every top creator on Substack has 3–6 styles that reliably perform.  
Notes Performance helps you find yours.


*P.S.*
*You can ask the AI assitant to help you with this.*

# 6. Turn This Into a Weekly Routine {#weekly-routine}

**Every Monday:**
1. Sort Notes by **Free Subs**  
2. Pick the top 7 Notes  
3. Save each to drafts  
4. Repurpose or slightly modify them  
5. Add to your Queue

**End result:**  
You always post Notes that you already know work.

---

# 7. The One Rule To Remember {#one-rule}

**If a Note performed once, it can perform again.  
If a Note performed twice, it should become a series.  
If a Note never performed, don’t overthink it. Just don't post it again.**

Notes Performance tells you exactly what to double down on.
