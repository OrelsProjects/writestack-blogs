# 📊 How To Use Your Statistics {#using-statistics}

This is your **practical**, no-fluff guide to making the most out of your WriteStack Stats page.

Use this guide to learn:
- how to interpret each chart  
- how to adjust your strategy weekly  
- how to find what’s working and what’s wasting your time  
- how to use the data the same way top Substack creators do  

---

# 1. Overview Metrics {#overview-metrics}

At the top you’ll see:

- **Total Notes Posted**  
- **Free Subscriptions**  
- **Paid Subscriptions**

### What to do with this section

- If **Notes Posted** is low(0-2/day) and your growth is flat → increase frequency to **atleast** 2/day.  
- If **Free Subs**/**Paid Subs** jump on certain days → either click the graph or go to  [Notes stats](https://www.writestack.io/notes-stats) and find which Notes worked.

**Tip:** Most creators grow fastest posting **3–5 Notes per day**.

# 2. Free Subscriptions Graph {#free-subs}

![Free Subscriptions](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/statistics/free-subs.png "scale=1.7")

This graph shows the exact days your Notes brought in new subscribers.

### How to use it (Free Subscriptions)

- Look for **spikes** → these are your winning Notes.  
- Look for **flat periods** → either your posting frequency was low, or your content wasn’t strong that week.  
- Match spikes to your Notes from that day to identify **repeatable formats**.

### Weekly test
Try:
- Week 1 → 1–2 Notes/day  
- Week 2 → 3–4 Notes/day  
- Week 3 → 5+ Notes/day  

Use the graph to determine which frequency gave you the strongest subscriber growth.

# 3. Paid Subscriptions Graph {#paid-subs}

(I don't monetize my Substack, so it's embarassing to show my graph. ;) )

This graph is here so you understand the bigger picture.

Don’t optimize Notes for paid conversions. Sure, you can try to use the same Note again to convert. But it will most likely give you a bunch of free subscribers again rather than paid ones.

It's more reliable to focus on Notes that brought in new free subscribers.

# 4. Note Clicks {#note-clicks}

![Note Clicks](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/statistics/note-clicks.png "scale=1.7")

This chart shows which Notes actually drove traffic back to your Substack. People will click on a note if:
1. It has a preview image to an article
2. It has a link
3. It's long enough and has *read more* button
4. It has an image
5. It was interesting enough and the user tried to go to your profile page

---

# 5. Notes Engagement (Likes, Restacks, Comments) {#engagement}

![Notes Engagement](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/statistics/notes-engagement.png "scale=1.7")

This is your main performance chart. It tells you what works.

### How to use it (Notes Engagement)    

**Likes** → Your audience enjoyed the Note.  
**Restacks** → Your Note reached new people (growth).  
**Comments** → You created depth or emotion.

### What to look for

- When **restacks spike** → that Note style is your growth engine.  
- When **comments increase** → that Note style builds community; I like writing 1 of those per day.
- When **likes rise but restacks stay low** → your content is safe. Add stronger opinions, stories, or hooks.

## Example Strategy Calibration {#example}

This graph shows a real example of adjusting posting frequency:

![Example Frequency](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/statistics/graph-example.png "scale=1.7")

- **1–3 Notes/day** → steady growth  
- **3+ Notes/day** → higher engagement  
- **Vacation** → noticeable dip  
- **5+ Notes/day** → breakout spike  

Use your own stats the same way: observe → adjust → grow.

# 6. Follower Activity (Hourly Breakdown) {#follower-activity}

![Follower Activity](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/statistics/followers-activity.png "scale=1.7")

This chart shows when your audience is actually active.

### How to use it (Follower Activity)

- Post your most important Notes **1–2 hours before the biggest activity spikes**.  
- If your evening hours spike → move all your important posts there.  
- Avoid wasting strong Notes during low-activity hours.

### Tip
Don't overoptimize this. If your schedule doesn't fit the spikes, it's **infinitely** better to post consistently than try to fit it.

---

# 7. Writing Activity Heatmap {#writing-activity}

![Writing Activity Heatmap](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/statistics/heatmap.png "scale=1.7")

This heatmap reveals how consistent you truly are.

### How to use it (Writing Activity Heatmap)

- **Dark clusters** → your momentum weeks (usually match with higher growth).  
- **Gaps** → where engagement often slows.  
- **Light streaks** → inconsistent posting leads to unpredictable results.

---

# Conclusion {#conclusion}

Use these charts weekly and you’ll know:
- what to post  
- when to post  
- how often to post  
- which Notes actually grow your audience  
- which formats convert  
- what’s killing your reach  

Small tweaks → big growth.
