A queue makes scheduling 10x easier.

**To create a queue:**

   ![Edit Queue Button](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/edit-queue-button.png)

Your queue is now ready.

Your followers activity will change over time. Scroll down in the edit queue dialog and you'll see their activity graph.
Click a bar to create a new schedule time for your Notes.

Manual Notes give you full control, ideal for raw ideas or quick posts.

# 3. Importing Notes {#importing-notes}

If you already have Notes sitting inside Substack or another tool, you can import them into WriteStack.

To import:
1. Go to **Notes → Drafts** and click **Import**.  
   (If you don't have any drafts, it will be shown along with the other buttons in the center of the screen)
   ![Import Notes Button](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/import-notes-button.png)
2. Follow the instructions in the dialog.

# 4. Scheduling Notes {#scheduling-notes}

WriteStack gives you **three ways to schedule Notes**, depending on how you prefer to work.

All scheduling requires the WriteStack extension and a Chromium browser, exactly like described in the [Scheduler Guide](/?post=guides-scheduler-guide).

---

## a. Scheduling via the Note Editor {#schedule-in-editor}

1. Open any Note.  
2. Click **Add to Queue** to push it to the next available time slot or click the arrow and **Schedule** to pick a specific time and date.  
   ![Add to Queue Button](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/add-to-queue-button.png)
   ![Schedule Button](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/schedule-button.png)

This is the most precise way. Best when you finish writing and want to schedule immediately.

---

## b. Scheduling via the Shortcut {#schedule-shortcut}

Each draft note has an **Add to Queue** button in the bottom center of it.
   ![Add to Queue Button](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/add-to-queue-shortcut.png)

Great for rapid scheduling.

---

## c. Batch Scheduling {#batch-schedule}

Batch scheduling lets you schedule multiple Notes at once.

1. Go to **Notes → Drafts** and click **Import**.  
2. Click **Batch schedule notes**.  
   ![Batch Schedule Notes Button](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/batch-schedule-button.png)

From there you can either schedule selected Notes or all Notes in the draft list.

WriteStack will attach each Note to the next available time slot in your queue, one after the other.

---

# 5. Reordering Scheduled Notes {#reordering-schedules}

You can reorder your upcoming Notes via **drag and drop**.

1. Open your **Notes → Scheduled Notes**.  
2. Hold and drag any Note to a new position.  
![Reorder Scheduled Notes](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/basics/drag-and-drop.png)

This lets you change the schedules easily.
