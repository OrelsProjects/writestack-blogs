# ✨ Improve Your Notes Generation {#improve-notes-generation}

WriteStack gives you several ways to control, shape, and fine-tune how your Notes are generated.  
This guide walks you through the tools available inside **AI Settings** and inside the **Notes Generator** itself.

---

## What you will learn

- How to set a global AI prompt that shapes your writing voice  
- How to pick topics the AI should focus on  
- How to refresh your content data to keep the AI updated  
- How to update your autogenerated writing description  
- How to improve each batch of Notes with the Additional Prompt  

---

# 1. Set Your Global Prompt {#global-prompt}

Your **Global Prompt** is the strongest control you have over how WriteStack writes for you.

It is added automatically to **every generation request**, and it can be **as long and detailed as you want**.  
The text box is intentionally large — write paragraphs, examples, rules, do’s/don’ts, tone instructions, anything.  
The more specific you are, the more accurate your Notes will be.

This is where you define your writing DNA:

- tone  
- personality  
- pacing  
- forbidden words or symbols  
- formatting style  
- level of slang or professionalism  
- how bold or safe the AI should be  
- quirks you want (or never want)

**To update your Global Prompt:**
1. Go to **AI Settings**.  
   ![AI Settings](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/improve-notes-generation/ai-settings.png)
2. Write your detailed prompt inside the large **Personal Prompt** text area.
   ![Global Prompt](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/improve-notes-generation/personal-prompt.png)

Examples of what users typically put inside:
- “Write in short, punchy sentences.”  
- “Never use em-dashes.”  
- “Make the writing bold and opinionated.”  
- “Sound like a friendly mentor.”  
- “Use simple English.”  
- “A bit of cussing is okay but keep it natural.”  
- “Never add emojis.”  
- “Avoid generic statements.”  
- “Always give context, not fluff.”  
- Multi-paragraph descriptions of their tone.

WriteStack will apply this to every Note generation, everywhere.


# 2. Add Relevant Topics {#topics}

Topics tell WriteStack **what themes** it should focus on when generating Notes.

If you write about marketing, psychology, solopreneurship, or software — your topics should reflect that.

**To update your Topics:**
1. Open **AI Settings**.
2. Scroll to the **Preferred Topics** section.  
   ![Preferred Topics](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/improve-notes-generation/preferred-topics.png)
3. Add the topics you want to consistently appear in your Notes.

The AI uses these to stay aligned with your niche and audience.

# 3. Refresh Your Data (Important) {#refresh-data}

Over time, your writing style changes. Your Substack notes and newsletters shift, evolve, and sharpen.

**Data Refresh** updates WriteStack’s understanding of:
- your tone  
- your topics  
- your writing style  
- your most common patterns  
- what your audience responds to  

This keeps the AI accurate.

**To refresh your data:**
1. Go to **AI Settings**.  
2. Click **Refresh Data**.  
   ![Refresh Data](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/improve-notes-generation/data-refresh.png)

Do this every once in a while — especially after publishing many new posts.

---

# 4. Update The System Description {#update-description}

In the settings, you can update the **System Description** to help the AI understand who you are better (usually accurate).

**To update your Writing Description:**
1. Open **AI Settings**.  
2. Scroll to **Generated Description**.  
   ![Generated Description](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/improve-notes-generation/generated-description.png)
3. Edit anything you want the AI to know about you.

Small tweaks here have a strong effect on your future Notes.

# 5. Use the Additional Prompt (Per-Batch) {#additional-prompt}

Inside the **Notes Generator**, you have one more option:  
**The Additional Prompt.**

This prompt only affects the **current batch** you are generating.  
It is perfect for temporary adjustments.

Use it when you want:
- a more sales-focused batch  
- a more educational tone  
- stronger hooks  
- more personality  
- more positivity or more directness  
- a single theme across all Notes in the batch

**To use it:**
1. Open **Notes Generator**.  
2. Look for the **Additional Prompt** field.  
   ![Additional Prompt](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/improve-notes-generation/additional-prompt.png)
3. Add temporary instructions (optional).

Examples:
- “Make these Notes more sales-oriented.”  
- “Focus only on Substack growth.”  
- “Make these spicy and contrarian.”  
- “Write them as if talking to beginners.”

This stacks on top of your Global Prompt for maximum flexibility.
