# 👻 How To Use Ghostwriter Mode {#ghostwriter}

Ghostwriter Mode lets you write, schedule, and manage Notes **for someone else**—without sharing passwords, logins, or access to anything they shouldn’t see.

If you:
- write Notes for clients  
- manage Substack accounts  
- run an agency  
- help creators stay consistent  

This is how you do it **properly**.

---

# 1. What Ghostwriter Mode Actually Does {#what-it-does}

Ghostwriter Mode allows:
- you to write Notes *as* your client  
- queue and schedule content for them  
- use AI on their content  

Without:
- account sharing  
- email access  
- security risk  

It’s permission-based. Clean. Reversible.

# 2. Creating Your Ghostwriter Profile {#create-profile}

First, **you** (the ghostwriter) need a profile.

### Steps

1. Go to [**Settings**](https://www.writestack.io/settings#ghostwriter) or [**Collaboration**](https://www.writestack.io/collaboration)
2. Click **Create Profile**
3. Put in your name and image

### What this does
This creates **your Ghostwriter identity** inside WriteStack.

You only do this **once**.

---

# 3. Generate Your Ghostwriter Token {#token}

After creating your profile, you’ll see a **Ghostwriter Token**.

![Ghostwriter Token](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/ghostwriter/ghostwriter-token.png)

This token is:
- unique to you  
- safe to share with clients  
- revocable anytime  

### Important
This token does **not** give access on its own.  
It only works when the client explicitly approves you.

---

# 4. Send the Token to Your Client {#send-token}

Send the token to your client.

That’s it. No setup on your side anymore.

They now need to approve you.

---

# 5. Client Side Setup (What Your Client Does) {#client-setup}

Your client needs to do the following:

1. Go to [**Settings**](https://www.writestack.io/settings#ghostwriter)
2. Open **Ghostwriter Access**
3. Go to the **Client** tab
4. Paste your token
5. Add you as a Ghostwriter

# 6. Writing Notes as a Ghostwriter {#writing}

After approval:

- You’ll see the client inside your WriteStack dashboard  
- You can switch between accounts  
- Everything you write is published *as them*  

You can:
- write Notes  
- save drafts  
- queue content  
- schedule posts  
- use AI normally

From your side, it feels like managing your own account.

---

# 8. Managing Multiple Clients {#multiple-clients}

If you work with multiple clients:
- each client adds you with their own token approval  
- each client stays isolated  
- you can switch between them anytime

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Final Scheduling Step (Client Required) {#important-scheduling}

After the ghostwriter finishes writing and scheduling Notes, **the client still needs to take one final action**.

This is critical. If they don’t do this, Notes **will not go out**.

### What the client must do

1. Open **WriteStack** on their own account  
2. Click **Fix scheduling warnings**  
![Fix Scheduling Warnings](https://cdn.writestack.io/writestack-app/blogs/ghostwriter/fix-scheduling-warning.png "scale=1.7")
3. Keep their **laptop running** at the scheduled time  


### Why this matters

Since Substack don't allow to schedule Notes natively, the client has to schedule them on his computer.
Ghostwriters **cannot** do this step for the client.

### Best practice

Tell every client:
- to open WriteStack once after scheduling is done  
- to click **Fix scheduling warnings**  
- to leave their laptop on when Notes are scheduled  

This avoids missed posts and confusion.

# 9. Revoking Access (For Both Sides) {#revoke}

Ghostwriter access can be removed anytime.

- Client can remove you

- You can disconnect yourself

# Conclusion {#conclusion}

Ghostwriter Mode lets you:
- write for clients safely  
- scale content without friction  
- avoid account sharing  
- manage multiple creators cleanly  

Just remember:  
**Ghostwriters schedule. Clients finalize.**
